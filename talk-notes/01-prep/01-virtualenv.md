So let's get started! First, we need to prep our project area: Using
your favorite IDE, shell, or file explorer, create a project directory.

Here, I'm calling it briefcase-bear, but you can name your project
whatever you like.

Next, we need to set up our virtual environment. You'll need Python 3.6
or later. Invoke your python interpreter and use the dash em flag and
give it the venv module.

This is another place where you get to make decisions: I really like
using dot venv for my virtual environments, but you can call it
something else if you'd like.

Now that your virtual environment is set up, we need to activate it.
This is slightly different on each platform, but source or run the
activate script.

Finally, we need to install briefcase: using the virtualenvironment's
pip, we'll call the install command and tell it briefcase.
