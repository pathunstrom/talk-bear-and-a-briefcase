I am Piper Thunstrom. By day I'm a senior software engineer who makes a
living doing web development.

By night, though, I work hard to make programming increasingly
accessible to a wider and wider audience. I've helped run local Python
user groups and volunteered for various roles at a couple of
conferences.

I do regular speaking engagements where I can be found
going on at length about some of my favorite technical topics, like game
dev, and the amazing power hidden in the corners of the Python standard
library. Or I might talk about harder topics, like coming out trans when
you're well known in your community.

I'm also a game developer and have focused a significant portion of my
career on sharing my love for games with others.

So today, I'm going to share a new recipe that has revealed a new Python
superpower: We're putting a bear in a briefcase by building a game with
PursuedPyBear and packaging it up for end users using Beeware's
Briefcase.
