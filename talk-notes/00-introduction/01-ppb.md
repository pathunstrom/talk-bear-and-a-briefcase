So let's start with PursuedPyBear. an education-focused game library
that I am the author and co-maintainer of. For brevity, I'll refer to it
as ppb for the rest of this talk.

ppb started its life as an ill-conceived MVC framework, complete with
strong separation of concerns and dependency injection. It didn't take
me long to realize that I was going down the wrong path when I
completely failed to make a game using it only six months after the
project started.

About the time I was ready to throw it out, I got a lot of requests to
focus on a game making tool specifically for CS education. That started
by doing a lot of research on API design, and rebuilding ppb to run the
API I wanted, instead of the software purity I had tried to design with
previously.

Now, we focus on a principles driven development, with a focus on
students and learners first, unleashing creativity without limitations
baked into the platform, a genuinely fun API, and a strong focus on
inclusion.
