Second, we need to cover BeeWare and Briefcase. BeeWare's focus is
expanding the boundaries of Python: write one code base, deploy it
everywhere. By everywhere, they say in their header: iOS, Android,
Windows, MacOS, Linux, Web, and tvOS.

This includes a bunch of neat tools and libraries that allow you to do
things Python just wasn't very good at before. Things like Toga, which
allows you to write GUIs that use the OS styled widgets in Python.

Today, though, we care about Briefcase: A packaging tool for Python
applications. If you've heard of Py2App or PyInstaller, you've got the
right idea of what briefcase does.
