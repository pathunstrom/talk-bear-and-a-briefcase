# Cooking Up Easy to Publish Games with a Bear and a Briefcase

## Description

One of the biggest challenges for games in Python is freezing and shipping to end users. Join Piper Thunstrom as she demonstrates two great recipes to deliver your video game to your users with no pain. Get a feel for  [Beeware's Briefcase](https://beeware.org/project/projects/tools/briefcase/) to set up our project and freeze your end user application, and see the ease of use of [ppb](https://ppb.dev) for building your own games.

Make real games that can really be installed on end users computers using pure Python.

## Audience Takeaways

What you should learn:

* The basics of using Briefcase to develop GUI apps in Python.
* The very basic ways to use ppb.
* The basic structure of uploading games to itch.io

The game the audience will be able to build if they have no games experience won't be very interesting, but it's a great start for getting into independent game development with Python.
